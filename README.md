# Protomaps Assets Basemaps

This repository is part of the **GeoJar Protomaps Stack** and is used to clone and manage assets from the **protomaps/basemaps-assets** repository, which are utilized for serving static map tiles and other assets on a website.

A full setup guide is available in the GitHub repository [geojar/protomaps-stack](https://github.com/geojar/protomaps-stack).

## Folder Structure

- **`public/`**: The final built will be placed here after running the build process.


## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to a local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/geojar/protomaps-assets-basemaps.git
cd protomaps-assets-basemaps
```

### 2. Build the Assets
After cloning the repository, run the following command to download the assets:

```bash
bash run_build.sh
```

This will:

- Clone the **protomaps/basemaps-assets** repository.
- Clean up unnecessary files (like `.git`, `.github`, etc.).
- Replace the contents in the `public/` directory on the host with the latest assets.

### 3. Deploy the Assets

Expose or upload the contents of the `public/` folder to the internet.  
For example, use **Cloudflare Pages** to host the directory as a static site.

## Cloudflare Pages Deployment

After the build process is completed, the `public/` directory is generated with all the necessary assets. **GeoJar** deploys this directory using **Cloudflare Pages**, which serves the built assets as a static website. Cloudflare Pages handles caching, routing, and other optimizations to ensure the website performs efficiently.
